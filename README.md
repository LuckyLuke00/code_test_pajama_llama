# Pajama Llama Games: Code Test üéÆ

Welcome to my code test attempt for an internship at Pajama Llama Games! This repository contains an enhanced version of the Unity 2D Platformer Microgame Project template. 

## üöÄ New Features

The project now includes the following features:

1. **Scalable Objective System**: Objectives are dynamically displayed on the HUD. The level can only be completed when all objectives are cleared.
2. **Dynamic Checkpoint System**: You can easily add more checkpoints in the editor. The system automatically detects them and sets the best checkpoint when the player reaches it.
3. **Double Jump**: Implemented a double jump with a customizable jump amount in the editor.
4. **Drop Attack**: When the player is in the air, and presses the down button the player will shoot straight down, and when hitting the floor bounce back up a little.
5. **Floating Health Bar**: A health bar is now displayed above the player.
6. **Health Pickup**: Added a red health pickup.
7. **Wall Collision Fix**: The jump is no longer canceled when hitting a wall.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

Here are the controls for the game:

- **WASD**: Move
- **Space**: Jump
- **S (while in the air)**: Drop attack
